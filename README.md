### Install

1. Clone the repo or download the Windows MSI installer from the releases tab
1. Have or get python 3.7 (or just use the installer on Windows)
3. Get the requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game `python3 game.py`

### Playing

1. Once the game loads there will be a welcome screen. Press enter to start playing
1. Controls are "A" for left, "D" for right, "SPACE" for jump, "E" for interact, and "ESC" to get out of a code editor
1. In the code editor use the arrow keys to move the cursor and the keyboard to type.
1. All the code you type is run by the game. There are some protections but it's not perfect. You can pretty much do anything.
1. a config file `site.cfg.json` is created in the root of the repo when the game is run. You can modify this file, but I wouldn't. A lot of the config options have only been tested with their default values.
